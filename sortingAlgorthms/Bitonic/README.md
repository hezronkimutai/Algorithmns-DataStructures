# Bitonic Sort

Bitonic sort is a parallel sorting algorithm which performs O(n2 log n) comparisons. Although, the number of comparisons are more than that in any other popular sorting algorithm, It performs better for the parallel implementation because elements are compared in predefined sequence which must not be depended upon the data being sorted. The predefined sequence is called Bitonic sequence.
