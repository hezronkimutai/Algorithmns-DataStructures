# Algorithmn
- Step 1:Find the largest number in ARR as LARGE
- Step 2: [INITIALIZE] SET NOP = Number of digits
in LARGE
- Step 3: SET PASS =0
- Step 4: Repeat Step 5 while PASS <= NOP-1
- Step 5: SET I = 0 and INITIALIZE buckets
- Step 6:Repeat Steps 7 to 9 while I
- Step 7: SET DIGIT = digit at PASSth place in A[I]
- Step 8: Add A[I] to the bucket numbered DIGIT
- Step 9: INCREMENT bucket count for bucket
numbered DIGIT
[END OF LOOP]
- Step 10: Collect the numbers in the bucket
[END OF LOOP]
- Step 11: END
