# Algorithmns-DataStructures

This repo is meant for practice.

From time to time I will be looking for problems from other sites e.g hacker_rank and solving them here.

I will also be copy pasting solution from other sources and playing with them to increase my understanding.

Feel free to star, fork or even contribute to the repo.

CHEERS!
